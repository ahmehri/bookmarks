### Compiling(Preprocessing) Queries

The need for compilation comes to [avoid runtime overhead](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/recipes/babel/) caused by colocating the queries in js files. This is not an issue when the files are kept in separate `.graphql` or `.gql` files, but keep in mind that you still need to preprocess them either by using:

- webpack `graphql-tag` [loader](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tag#webpack-preprocessing-with-graphql-tagloader)
- babel plugin [babel-plugin-graphql-tag](https://github.com/gajus/babel-plugin-graphql-tag), which uses `graphql-tag` under the hood.

In case you're colocating the queries in js files, then you need to use either bable plugin or macro to do the compilation. The plugin is [babel-plugin-graphql-tag](https://github.com/gajus/babel-plugin-graphql-tag) and there are two macros:

- [graphql-tag.macro](https://github.com/leoasis/graphql-tag.macro) as documented in apollo recipe.
- [graphql.macro](https://github.com/evenchange4/graphql.macro) as documented in cra [guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/loading-graphql-files).

Using a macro is prefered because it requires less configuration and is more explicit as explained [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/recipes/babel/#using-graphql-tagmacro).
